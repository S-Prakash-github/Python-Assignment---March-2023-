    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model, and indicates how well the model fits the observed data.\n",

A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the model is good, as it may still suffer from issues such as multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and outliers. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the model using multiple criteria and to validate it using independent data sets."

By adding a penalty term to the cost function, these models can reduce the magnitude of the coefficients and prevent overfitting.

While this can be beneficial for high-dimensional data, it may result in a bias towards certain variables, especially if they are highly correlated with each other.\n",

    "- Interpretability: Regularized linear models can make it difficult to interpret the coefficients of the predictor variables, especially when L1 regularization is used. This is because L1 regularization can lead to sparse models with some coefficients set to zero, making it harder to understand the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable.\n",
