    "Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing data using measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and frequency distributions. These measures provide a quantitative summary of the data and help to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. Descriptive statistics are used when we want to understand the characteristics of a particular group or population. Examples of when descriptive statistics might be used include:\n",
    "A market researcher might use descriptive statistics to summarize the demographic characteristics of a target market.\n",
    "- An epidemiologist might use descriptive statistics to describe the incidence and prevalence of a disease in a population.\n",
    "- A teacher might use descriptive statistics to summarize the performance of their students on a test.\n",

Inferential statistics are used when we want to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Examples of when inferential statistics might be used include:\n",

    "- A medical researcher might use inferential statistics to test whether a new drug is effective in reducing the symptoms of a disease in a population.\n",

Examples of discrete data include the number of siblings a person has, the number of cars in a parking lot, and the number of books in a library.\n",

    "- Ordinal data: This type of qualitative data consists of categories or labels that can be ordered or ranked according to a particular criterion. Ordinal data represents a hierarchy or ranking of values, but the differences between the values are not necessarily equal. Examples of ordinal data include educational level (e.g. high school, college, graduate school), the severity of a disease (e.g. mild, moderate, severe), and customer satisfaction ratings (e.g. very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied).\n"

Because the test score data is on an interval scale, we can calculate measures such as the mean and standard deviation, but we cannot perform multiplication or division with the data. This means that we cannot meaningfully compare ratios of test scores, such as saying that one student's score is twice as high as another student's score.\n",

    "Descriptive statistics is used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a set of data. It involves measures such as central tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (standard deviation, variance), and frequency distribution. Descriptive statistics provide information about the data itself and are useful for identifying patterns and trends within the data. For example, a study of college student performance might use descriptive statistics to summarize the grade point averages of a group of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, inferential statistics is used to make inferences about a larger population based on a sample of data. It involves statistical tests such as hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics help researchers to draw conclusions about the population from a smaller subset of data. For example, a study of a new drug might use inferential statistics to determine if the drug is effective by comparing the treatment group to a control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics, consider a survey of 1,000 people about their favorite type of pizza. Descriptive statistics would summarize the data by providing information about the most popular type of pizza, the frequency of each type of pizza, and other characteristics of the data set. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, would be used to make predictions about the population based on the sample data. For example, a researcher might use inferential statistics to estimate the percentage of people in a larger population who prefer pepperoni pizza based on the survey data."

    "Measures of central tendency and variability are important tools used in statistics to describe a dataset. Some common measures of central tendency and variability include:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mean: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. The mean is often used as a measure of central tendency and provides an indication of the average value in a dataset. The mean can be influenced by outliers, or extreme values, in the dataset.It  gives us idea about the average of a perticular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. The median is another measure of central tendency and is less influenced by outliers compared to the mean. The median is particularly useful when the data is skewed, meaning that the distribution of values is not symmetrical. It can be used to fill missing values in a dataset and when compared with the mean it can tell us the presence of an outlier in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. The mode is another measure of central tendency and can be used to describe the most common value in a dataset. The mode is particularly useful when the data is categorical or when the distribution of values is bimodal, meaning that there are two peaks in the distribution.Mode is used for replacing missing values from the dataset in a categorical column .\n",
    "\n",
    ">Standard deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of variability that describes how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean. The standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance. The standard deviation provides an indication of the spread of values in a dataset and is often used to describe the precision of measurements or the variability within a group of data.In a a dataset we can find out the position of a perticular datapoint.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The range provides a measure of the spread of values in a dataset and can be used to describe the extent of variability in a dataset."
