    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating population parameters (such as mean, variance, proportion) based on sample data. Estimation statistics involves using sample statistics to make inferences about population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate a population parameter. It is typically calculated using a sample statistic, such as the sample mean or sample proportion. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of all students in a university, we can take a random sample of students and calculate the sample mean height. The sample mean height is a point estimate of the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimate, on the other hand, is a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. Interval estimates are typically calculated using a point estimate and a measure of its precision, such as the standard error or the margin of error. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of all students in a university with 95% confidence, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval using the sample mean height and the standard error of the mean. The resulting interval estimate would be a range of values within which we are 95% confident the population mean height falls."

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether a particular hypothesis or claim about a population is supported by the available evidence. It involves collecting data from a sample of the population and then using statistical techniques to determine whether the evidence supports or contradicts the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is used in a wide range of fields, including science, medicine, engineering, finance, and marketing. It is particularly useful in situations where we want to draw conclusions about a large population based on a relatively small sample of data. Hypothesis testing allows us to make inferences about a population using data from a sample while controlling for the possibility of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to provide a systematic and objective way to evaluate evidence and make decisions based on that evidence. Without hypothesis testing, it would be difficult to determine whether a particular claim or hypothesis is supported by the available data, and we would be forced to rely on intuition or guesswork.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing also allows us to quantify the degree of uncertainty associated with our conclusions. By calculating the probability of obtaining our results by chance, we can assess the strength of the evidence and make more informed decisions. This is particularly important in fields such as medicine and science, where decisions based on faulty or inadequate evidence can have serious consequences."

    "The Student's t-distribution is a probability distribution that is used to model the distribution of the t-statistic, which is a measure of the difference between the sample mean and the null hypothesis mean in units of the standard error of the sample mean. The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution, but is wider and more spread out, especially when the sample size is small.\n",

    "The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.

The t-distribution accounts for this additional uncertainty by providing a wider and more spread out distribution than the normal distribution.\n",

    "We use the t-distribution to calculate critical values for the t-statistic and to determine the p-value associated with the t-statistic. The critical values are used to determine whether the difference between the sample mean and the null hypothesis mean is statistically significant at a given level of significance, while the p-value is used to determine the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one calculated, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
