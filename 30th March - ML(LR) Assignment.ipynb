    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the properties of both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It is used to overcome the limitations of these two techniques and is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with a large number of predictors and multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the cost function is a combination of both the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms. This means that the regression coefficients are constrained by both the L1 and L2 norms, which helps to overcome the limitations of each technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression differs from Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression in several ways. Unlike Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression can perform variable selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero. On the other hand, Lasso Regression is better suited for high-dimensional datasets with a large number of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression also allows for a tuning parameter that controls the relative weight of the L1 and L2 regularization terms, which can be adjusted to optimize the model's performance. In contrast, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression only have one tuning parameter each.\n",

Bayesian optimization can be more efficient than grid search and random search for large datasets and a large number of regularization parameters.\n",
