    "Simple linear regression is a statistical technique used to study the relationship between two continuous variables. It aims to find a linear relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one independent variable (X). The resulting model is represented by a straight line equation of the form Y = a + bX, where \"a\" is the intercept, \"b\" is the slope, and X is the independent variable.\n",

    "For example, suppose we want to study the relationship between a student's test score (Y) and the number of hours they studied (X). A simple linear regression model could be created to determine how much the test score (Y) changes with each additional hour of study (X).\n",

    "Multiple linear regression is similar to simple linear regression but involves more than one independent variable. It is used when we want to study the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and two or more independent variables (X1, X2, X3, etc.).

    "Linear regression is a commonly used statistical technique to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. There are several assumptions that must be met for linear regression to be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s) must be linear. This means that as the independent variable(s) change, the change in the dependent variable should be proportional to that change. One way to check this assumption is by creating a scatterplot of the dependent variable against each independent variable. If the points form a straight line, then the assumption is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other. This means that one observation should not be influenced by another observation. This assumption can be checked by examining the data collection methods to ensure that there is no overlap or dependence between the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all values of the independent variable(s). In other words, the variability of the residuals should be the same for all values of the independent variable(s). This assumption can be checked by plotting the residuals against the predicted values. If there is a clear pattern or trend, then the assumption is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the residuals should be symmetrically distributed around zero. One way to check this assumption is by creating a histogram of the residuals or by using a normal probability plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: In the case of multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. This means that each independent variable should provide unique information to the model. One way to check this assumption is by calculating the correlation coefficient between each pair of independent variables. If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, then the assumption is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, there are several assumptions of linear regression, including linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality, and no multicollinearity. These assumptions can be checked by examining the data visually using scatterplots, residual plots, histograms, and normal probability plots, as well as through statistical tests. If these assumptions are not met, it may be necessary to modify the model or consider a different statistical technique altogether."

In stochastic gradient descent, the gradient is computed on a single training example or a small batch of examples at a time.
